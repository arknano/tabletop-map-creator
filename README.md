# tabletop-map-creator
A map creator for tabletop games (Dungeon and Dragons, Shadowrun, etc) utilising Unity's preview tilemapping system.

Intent is to create an application that can be used to output images to use either in print or via online tabletops, with a saving system to allow the sharing and editing of maps.

Presently running only in the editor with no standalone build available.

Requires Unity 5.5.0x3-2D-Build
